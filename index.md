## Selection Structures

This is a short script showing a variety of exercises for selection Structures, also using prompt and alert windowns methods:
1. The first exercise consist in write a script that displays even numbers from 2 to 50 in descending order, not including 10
nor 40. Using the FOR loop. 
2. Create a script that, using a FOR loop, reads 10 numbers and determines Number of Even Numbers, Number of Odds, Major Number and Minor Number.
3. Create a script that reads the angle measures of 10 triangles. Determine and show if the triangle is right, acute or obtuse. Use the FOR loop.
4. Create a script that allows you to read N letters, determine the number of vowels and consonants that were read. Show the results. Using the WHILE loop.
5. A store requires a method of billing for the products it sells. For this purpose, you must create a script that allows reading the name of the product, the quantity of each item and its price. You should go adding the value to pay for each product and at the end, show the total amount to pay. This amount you must apply 13% for sales tax and show the total to pay. take into account that, if the client is FREQUENT, a 10% discount will be applied to the total. must work for N items. Using the WHILE loop.
